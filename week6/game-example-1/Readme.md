#### Intro
A **Shoot Em Up**, or **STG** in Japan, style game simply allows a player to fire bullets and other weapons at an enemy, whilst trying to avoid their attack.

The classic example, of course, is **Space Invaders**, which largely popularised this genre of game.

However, there are many different examples of this style of game.

#### Different types
Whilst the general gameplay is the same for each type of STG, there are a few notable variants. For example, we may consider viewpoint and movement as an easy way of differentiating various different examples. These may include,

  * fixed shooters
  * rail shooters
  * scrolling shooters
  * ...

#### Game versions
The following versions are available:

##### Sprites/Collisions
  * v0.5 - shooter0.5.py
    * better collisions and detection
        * change bounding box for player and mob sprite objects
        * change bounding box to circle, and modify radius to fit sprite objects
